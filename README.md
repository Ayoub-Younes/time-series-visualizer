# Page View Time Series Visualizer

## Project Overview
The Page View Time Series Visualizer is a Python-based application that analyzes and visualizes page view data from freeCodeCamp's forum. This project uses various libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations, including a line plot for daily page views, a bar plot for monthly averages, and box plots to analyze trends and seasonality in page views. The visualizations provide a clear understanding of how page views have varied over time, helping to identify patterns and trends in user engagement.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data manipulation and visualization.
Pandas: Utilized for data handling, cleaning, and preparation.
Matplotlib: Employed for creating line and bar plots, as well as box plots.
Seaborn: Used to enhance the visual appeal of box plots.
NumPy: Incorporated for numerical operations and calculations.
This project demonstrates how to process time series data and extract meaningful insights through visual representation, allowing users to better understand the dynamics of forum engagement over time.
